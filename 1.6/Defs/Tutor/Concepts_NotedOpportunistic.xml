        <helpText>The mod features advanced tool management systems that maximize efficiency and productivity:

AUTOMATIC OPTIMIZATION:
• Colonists automatically select the best available tools for each task
• They prioritize equipped tools over inventory tools when multiple options exist
• Tools currently being used are marked as 'in use' to prevent conflicts

SMART FEATURES:
• Pre-work tool pickup: Colonists acquire optimal tools before starting jobs
• Automatic tool swapping: They'll upgrade to better tools when available
• Intelligent inventory management: Excess or inferior tools are dropped as needed

This creates a seamless workflow where colonists always work with the most effective equipment available.</helpText>

        <priority>50</priority>
        <helpText>Tools are not permanent and require ongoing maintenance to remain effective:

DEGRADATION MECHANICS:
• Tools wear down with each use, eventually breaking completely
• Degradation rate varies by difficulty mode (up to 87.5% faster in Extra Hardcore)
• Different materials and tool quality affect durability significantly

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES:
• Check tool condition via info cards to plan replacements
• Maintain backup tools for critical tasks
• Monitor the "Tools need replacing" alert for tools near failure
• Consider material choice when crafting - better materials last longer

The estimated lifespan shown on tool info cards reflects continuous usage but doesn't account for current condition, so damaged tools will break sooner than indicated.</helpText>
