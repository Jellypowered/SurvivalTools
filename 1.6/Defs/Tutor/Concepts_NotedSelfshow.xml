        <helpText>Proper tools are crucial for effective colony operations and survival. Without the right equipment, colonists may work inefficiently or become completely unable to perform critical tasks.

TO EQUIP TOOLS:
• Select a colonist and right-click any tool
• Choose to equip it in their main hand or add to inventory
• Colonists can carry up to 2-3 tools in inventory simultaneously
• Tool belts (crafted at tailoring benches) increase carrying capacity

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
• Different tools excel at specific tasks (axes for trees, pickaxes for mining)
• Tool quality and material significantly affect performance
• In Hardcore modes, many tasks become impossible without proper tools
• Plan tool distribution among colonists based on their work assignments</helpText>
