Phase 9 Pre-flight Legacy References

Legacy classes / patterns discovered:
- Source/AI/JobGiver_OptimizeSurvivalTools.cs
- Source/AI/AutoToolPickup_UtilityIntegrated.cs (Patch_JobGiver_Work_TryIssueJobPackage_AutoTool)
- Patch_Pawn_JobTracker_ExtraHardcore (only referenced in comments / removed already)
- Legacy gear tab patches: superseded by Harmony/ITab_Gear_ST.cs (no separate legacy injector classes found beyond ST patch guard)
- Harmony legacy gating patches (PlantCut/ Sower / MissingRequiredCapacity / Scanner etc.) still present: Patch_WorkGiver_* files

XML thinkRoot references:
- 1.6/Defs/ThinkTreeDefs/SubTrees_Misc.xml -> <thinkRoot Class="SurvivalTools.JobGiver_OptimizeSurvivalTools" />

Actions pending:
- Replace JobGiver_OptimizeSurvivalTools implementation with stub or remove Harmony usage (already stubbed but duplicate now after LegacyForwarders.cs).
- Remove HarmonyPatch attribute from AutoToolPickup legacy patch or guard with symbol.
- Introduce PatchGuard allowlist & sweeping (existing ST_PatchGuard present; will extend later).
