All new code should follow the existing project structure patterns. Files should be organized by feature area (AI, Harmony, Helpers, etc.) and class names should clearly indicate their purpose. Public APIs should be well-documented with XML comments, and internal methods should use clear naming conventions to distinguish them from public members.
