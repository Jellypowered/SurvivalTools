description: Ensures consistent and reliable Harmony patching across the mod.
---

All Harmony patches should be properly documented with clear purpose statements. Patches should be minimal and focused, avoiding unnecessary code changes. Use appropriate prefix/postfix/transpiler patterns, and ensure all patches are properly registered in the HarmonyPatches.cs file. All patch methods should be clearly marked and tested for compatibility.
